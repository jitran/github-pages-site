# Change visibility of site

- You can restrict access to your project site by publishing the site privately.

- A privately published site can only be accessed by people with read access to the repository the site is published from. 

- You can use privately published sites to share your internal documentation or knowledge base with members of your enterprise.

- Note: To publish a GitHub Pages site privately, your organisation must use GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

- If your enterprise uses EMU, access control is not available, and all GitHub Pages sites are only accessible to other enterprise members.

- If your organisation uses GitHub Enterprise Cloud without EMU, you can choose to publish your project sites privately or publicly to anyone on the internet.

- Access control is available for project sites that are published from a private or internal repository that are owned by the organisation.

- You cannot manage access control for an organisation site.
