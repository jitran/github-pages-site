# Publishing sources for GitHub Pages sites

- You can publish your site when changes are pushed to a specific branch and folder, or you can write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site.

- If you do not need any control over the build process for your site, we recommend that you publish your site when changes are pushed to a specific branch.

- You can specify which branch and folder to use as your publishing source.

- **Warning:** For non EMU: GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet by default, even if the repository for the site is private or internal. You can publish a site privately by managing access control for the site. Otherwise, if you have sensitive data in your site's repository, you may want to remove the data before publishing.*
