# Publishing sources for GitHub Pages sites (cont.)

- Static content for your GitHub Pages site can be generated by Jekyll or GitHub Actions workflow.

- Jekyll is a static site generator with [built-in](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) support for GitHub Pages.

- If you want to use a build process other than Jekyll or you do not want a dedicated branch to hold your compiled static files, write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site.

- GitHub Enterprise Cloud provides starter workflows for common publishing scenarios to help you write your workflow.
