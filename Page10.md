# Exercise 2 - Publish a site using a different branch

- Go to your `hello-world` repository.

- Create a new file with a path of `site/README.md` with the following content:
   ```md
   ## Exercise 2
   It's working!
   ```

- Push the changes to a new branch called `staging`.

- Go to your `hello-world` repository > Settings > Pages.

- Under Branch, select the staging branch and select the `/site` folder.

- Save the changes and wait a while for the new site to be deployed.

- Access `https://<user>.github.io/hello-world` and it should display "It's working!"
