# Types of GitHub Pages sites (cont.)

- To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your personal account that's named `<username>.github.io`.

- To publish an organisation site, you must create a repository owned by an organisation that's named `<organisation>.github.io`.

- The user and organisation sites are available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io` or `http(s)://<organisation>.github.io`.

- Project sites are available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository>` or `http(s)://<organisation>.github.io/<repository>`.

- If you use a custom domain, the sites will begin with `http(s)://<custom-domain>`.
