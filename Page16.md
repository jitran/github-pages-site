# Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages

- You can increase the security of your custom domain and avoid takeover attacks by verifying your domain.

- When you verify a custom domain for your organisation, only repositories owned by that organisation may be used to publish a GitHub Pages site to the verified custom domain or the domain's immediate subdomains.

- Verifying your domain stops other GitHub users from taking over your custom domain and using it to publish their own GitHub Pages site.

- When you verify a domain, any immediate subdomains are also included in the verification. For example, if the github.com custom domain is verified, docs.github.com, support.github.com, and any other immediate subdomains will also be protected from takeovers.
