# Deleting a GitHub Pages site

- You can delete your site in two ways:
  1. Delete the repository.
  2. Change the source to the None branch.
     - Go to your repository > Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source > Deploy from a branch
     - Under Branch, select None to delete your site.

- If you want to remove the current deployment of your site but do not want to delete the site, you can unpublish your site.
  - Go to your repository > Settings > Pages, click on the "..." next to "Visit site", and click "Unpublish site".
